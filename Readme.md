The sopnode consists of various baseband and RF band devices. These devices are accessed by kubetnets pods on high performance sopnode servers. The Fabric-TNA based sopnode network called P4 network (as its switches are configurable via P4 code) facilitate this connectivity. The kubernets pods hosted on these servers connects to P4 network via kubernetes network extension and attachements. As sopnode is expected to support very high speed and low latency to support the testing of beyond 5G technology, it is required to benchmark and proliferate sopnode links and possible interconnection. This document presents a simple testsetup within sopnode kubernetes cluster to perform such performance measurements.
